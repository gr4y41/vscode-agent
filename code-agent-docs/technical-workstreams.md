### Stack/Tools

* AST parsing (Tree-sitter, Babel, ts-morph)
* Source maps / comment annotations
* File watchers

**Owner:** Full-Stack Engineer

**Priority:** Medium-High

---

## 6. **Memory & History Inspector**

**Objective:** View and manipulate agents' long-term and short-term memory

### Tasks

* 📜 Visual timeline/history view of memory events
* 🧬 Searchable memory snapshots with diff view
* ✏️ Editable fields (e.g., force override of system memory)

### Stack/Tools

* IndexedDB (default)
* Optional: Chroma, Weaviate, or Pinecone for vector memory
* Visual layer in React or Svelte

**Owner:** Data Engineer + Frontend Engineer

**Priority:** Medium

---

## 7. **Collaboration Infrastructure (Long-Term)**

**Objective:** Enable real-time collaboration and agent-to-agent interactions

### Tasks

* 👥 Add user presence and shared graph editing (WebRTC or CRDT)
* 🌐 Enable agents to send simulated or live messages to each other
* 🕒 Versioning system for agents and node groups

### Stack/Tools

* Y.js or Automerge (CRDT)
* Temporal / Redis Streams (message bus)
* Authentication and permissions (OAuth, JWT)

**Owner:** Collaboration/Backend Engineer

**Priority:** Long-Term

---

## 8. **Developer Telemetry and Analytics**

**Objective:** Track agent usage, performance, and developer feedback loops

### Tasks

* 📊 Track events: agent launches, LLM calls, graph interactions
* ⏱️ Measure time-to-success for agent prototypes
* 📣 Optional opt-in feedback prompts (e.g., “Was this suggestion helpful?”)

### Stack/Tools

* PostHog, Amplitude, or custom metrics service
* Local data anonymization layer

**Owner:** Data Platform Engineer

**Priority:** Post-MVP

---

## 9. **Security, Packaging, and Distribution**

**Objective:** Distribute the application securely and efficiently

### Tasks

* 🔐 Harden sandbox boundaries (especially if executing agent code)
* 🛠️ Bundle into desktop binaries (Mac, Linux, Windows)
* 🧩 Add VSIX export of key extensions for modular install

### Stack/Tools

* Electron Builder
* Code signing + update server
* SAST/DAST pipelines (optional)

**Owner:** DevOps / Security Engineer

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

| Concern             | Approach                                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Latency**         | Local caching, background prefetching                 |
| **Modularity**      | Plugin API for new agent types and visual node styles |
| **Accessibility**   | Keyboard navigation, screen reader support            |
| **Docs/Onboarding** | Tooltips, walkthroughs, demo templates                |
