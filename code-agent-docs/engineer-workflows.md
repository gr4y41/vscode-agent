## Critical Path Management

The following dependencies form the critical path:

1. VSCode Fork → Extension System → UI Hooks
   - **Risk Mitigation**: Core Platform Engineer starts with minimal viable fork
   - **Fallback**: UI Engineer can develop against standard VSCode extension API initially

2. Graph Canvas → Node System → Code Integration
   - **Risk Mitigation**: Build on established visualization libraries
   - **Fallback**: Simplified graph representation with limited visual features

3. Agent Runtime → Memory System → Debugging Tools
   - **Risk Mitigation**: Early focus on core execution model
   - **Fallback**: File-based memory system with limited query capabilities

4. LLM Integration → Template System → Agent Assistance
   - **Risk Mitigation**: Start with single provider support
   - **Fallback**: Static templates with limited customization

## Progress Tracking

- GitHub project board with task assignments
  - Kanban-style workflow
  - Story points for effort estimation
  - Blocking relationships explicitly marked

- Weekly status updates and demonstrations
  - Monday morning status reports
  - Friday demonstrations of new features
  - Blockers highlighted for immediate attention

- Bi-weekly integration milestones
  - Clear acceptance criteria for each milestone
  - Go/no-go decision points
  - Retrospective after each milestone

- Individual feature acceptance criteria from MVP specification
  - Features linked to MVP requirements
  - Explicit testing criteria for each feature
  - User acceptance testing for key workflows

- Daily standup meetings for blocking issues
  - 15-minute time-boxed meetings
  - Focus on blockers and dependencies
  - Cross-team pairing for critical issues

This allocation ensures each engineer has a focused area of responsibility while maintaining clear dependencies and integration points for efficient parallel development of the AgentForge system.

## Extension-based Development Strategy

Using the modular extension pattern observed in AI-CODING-PLATFORMS extensions, AgentForge will be implemented as a set of distinct VSCode extensions:

1. **agentforge-core**: Base fork and platform functionality
2. **agentforge-graph**: Graph visualization and editing
3. **agentforge-runtime**: Agent execution environment
4. **agentforge-memory**: Memory persistence and visualization
5. **agentforge-navigation**: Code-graph bidirectional synchronization

Each extension will:
- Be developed by a dedicated engineer
- Have clearly defined API contracts
- Maintain compatibility with other extensions
- Activate on startup (`onStartupFinished`)
- Communicate through the shared message bus
- Include comprehensive documentation and tests

This extension-based architecture enables:
- Parallel development without conflicts
- Clean separation of concerns
- Independent versioning and deployment
- Future extensibility by third parties
- Better alignment with engineer specializations

This allocation ensures each engineer has a focused area of responsibility while maintaining clear dependencies and integration points for efficient parallel development of the AgentForge system.
