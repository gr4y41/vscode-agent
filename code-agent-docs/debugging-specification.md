# AgentForge Debugging Specification

## Overview

This document specifies the debugging capabilities of AgentForge, detailing how developers can inspect, troubleshoot, and understand agent behaviors. The debugging system is designed to provide transparency into agent execution, memory states, and decision-making processes, with specialized tools that go beyond traditional debugging to address the unique challenges of agent-based systems.

## Debugging Challenges in Agent Systems

Agent systems present unique debugging challenges:

1. **Non-deterministic Behavior** - Agents may behave differently given the same inputs due to LLM variability
2. **Complex State** - Agents maintain rich memory states that affect decision-making
3. **Distributed Logic** - Workflows span multiple agents with asynchronous communication
4. **Opacity** - LLM reasoning is often opaque without explicit instrumentation
5. **Temporal Complexity** - Behaviors evolve over time and across interactions
