# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Title

**AgentForge**
*(Provisional name — subject to branding discussions)*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

AgentForge is a next-generation development environment built on a fork of Visual Studio Code (VSCode), purpose-built for AI-first, agentic software development. Unlike standard IDEs or AI-enhanced editors like AI-CODING-PLATFORMS, AgentForge enables developers to visually construct, introspect, and refine autonomous agents and their interactions within complex systems.

By fusing traditional code editing with visual, graph-based representations of agents, AgentForge supports faster prototyping, debugging, and iteration of AI-driven workflows. The system is designed to be modular, highly interactive, and extensible, empowering a wide range of developer personas focused on intelligent automation, multi-agent systems, and real-time adaptive software.

## 2. Problem Statement

Current software development environments are insufficient for developers building autonomous or AI-augmented systems. Major challenges include:

* **Fragmentation** between code, memory, workflows, and agent management.
* **Lack of visualization** tools to inspect agents' mental models, connections, and state transitions.
* **Minimal AI support** for debugging or iterative refinement of intelligent behaviors.
* **Inflexibility** in modifying or orchestrating agent workflows across multiple layers of abstraction.

AgentForge addresses these shortcomings by embedding agent-centric functionality into the development workflow from the ground up.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

### Short-Term Goals (MVP)

* Fork and customize VSCode to support agent-aware architecture.
* Design an extensible **Visual Agent Graph** interface.
* Enable **bi-directional navigation** between visual nodes and code.
* Integrate an LLM assistant for **context-aware editing** and recommendations.

### Long-Term Goals

* Allow **autonomous execution and orchestration** of agents within the IDE.
* Support **pluggable memory systems** and reusable agent templates.
* Provide **real-time performance metrics** and optimization insights.
* Enable **collaborative development**, including agent-to-agent and user-to-user interactions.

---

## 4. Target Audience

* **LLM agent developers** using LangChain, AutoGen, OpenAgents, etc.
* **AI/ML researchers** building or testing multi-agent environments.
* **Startups and teams** deploying intelligent automation tools.
* **Indie developers and tinkerers** creating innovative agent-based applications.

---

## 5. Key Features

### Core Features

* **Visual Agent Graph**
  Graphical interface showing agents, their relationships, memory links, and workflow nodes.

* **Bi-directional Editing**
  Click any visual node to jump to the related code and vice versa.

* **Agent-Aware Sidebar**
  Includes tools for launching, debugging, configuring, and visualizing agent state.

* **Contextual AI Editing**
  Use agent personas to recommend changes, simulate behaviors, or offer design suggestions.

* **Memory Inspector**
  View and modify short- and long-term memory representations.

* **Playground Mode**
  Isolated canvas for testing agent behaviors outside the main graph.

### AI-Specific Features

* **LLM-backed editing assistant**
  Suggests edits, completes functions, and provides refactoring suggestions.

* **Agent-to-agent communication simulation**
  Preview message flows and logic between agents.

* **Autonomous refactoring**
  Suggest code structure changes based on detected inefficiencies.

## 6. Technical Considerations

### Foundation

* **Codebase**: Fork of VSCode (Electron + TypeScript)
* **UI Components**: Reuse VSCode’s extension model where possible

### Tech Stack

* **LLM Providers**: OpenAI, Claude, local models via Ollama/LM Studio
* **Graph Rendering**: Cytoscape.js or D3.js
* **Data Layer**: IndexedDB for local persistence, optional sync with vector DBs (e.g., Chroma, Weaviate)

### Architecture

* Modular extension loader
* Embedded runtime for agent execution
* Local server for AI requests with caching support

---

## 7. User Experience

### Interaction Model

* **Node click** → Opens code file and highlights relevant method/class
* **Drag and drop** → Rearranges agent workflows
* **Command palette** → Prompt agents, simulate flows, or access tools
* **Annotations** → Attach comments, goals, or version notes to nodes

### Modes of Operation

* **Builder Mode**: Visual-first workflow editor
* **Code Mode**: Enhanced code editor with full LLM support
* **Simulate Mode**: Run agent systems in a controlled sandbox environment

---

## 8. Risks and Challenges

* **VSCode fork complexity**: Frequent upstream changes may require ongoing sync work.
* **Performance overhead**: Graph rendering and LLM calls could create latency.
* **User onboarding**: Learning curve for users unfamiliar with agent architectures.
* **LLM reliance**: Risk of hallucination or incorrect suggestions from language models.

---

## 9. Success Metrics

* **Time to deploy**: Time required for users to deploy a functioning agent system
* **Cycle reduction**: Decrease in time between iterations (edit → test → deploy)
* **Feature usage**: Ratio of graph-based edits vs code-only interactions
* **Retention**: Daily and weekly active users across each mode
* **Feedback quality**: Number and resolution time of user-reported issues or requests

---

## 10. Next Steps

1. **MVP Definition**

   * Identify critical path features: Graph UI, agent sidebar, code sync, LLM edits

2. **UI/UX Design**

   * Wireframes for Graph View and Sidebar
   * Interaction flows between views

3. **LLM Use Case Mapping**

   * Define how/where models will be used
   * Select providers and caching strategy

4. **Prototype Development**

   * Build agent-aware extension prototype
   * Validate round-trip between visual nodes and code

5. **Community Feedback**

   * Share preview with target developers
   * Collect qualitative input before launch
