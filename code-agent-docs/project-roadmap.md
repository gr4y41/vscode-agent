# AgentForge Project Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the step-by-step approach to developing AgentForge from initial setup to MVP launch. Each phase includes concrete deliverables, dependencies, and estimated timelines to ensure coherent progress toward our goals.

Drawing inspiration from the AI-CODING-PLATFORMS extensions in VSCode, AgentForge will be developed as a set of modular extensions, each with specific responsibilities. This approach enables parallel development and clear separation of concerns.

## Extension Architecture

AgentForge will consist of these core extensions:

1. **agentforge-core**: Base VSCode fork and platform infrastructure
2. **agentforge-graph**: Visual graph editor and node manipulation
3. **agentforge-runtime**: Agent execution environment
4. **agentforge-memory**: Memory system and visualization
5. **agentforge-navigation**: Code-graph bidirectional linking

Each extension will be developed following established VSCode extension patterns with well-defined activation events, contribution points, and messaging interfaces.
