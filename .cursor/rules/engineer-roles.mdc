# AgentForge Engineer Roles

Description: Overview of the different engineering roles in the AgentForge project. Request when you need to understand the responsibilities of each role, their ownership boundaries, or which role should handle a particular task.

AgentForge development is organized around specific engineering roles, each responsible for different aspects of the system.

## Core Roles

- **Core Platform Engineer** - Responsible for `agentforge-core` extension and VSCode fork customizations
- **UI/Graph Engineer** - Responsible for `agentforge-graph` extension and visual editor components
- **Agent Runtime Engineer** - Responsible for `agentforge-runtime` and `agentforge-memory` extensions
- **Integration & Sync Engineer** - Responsible for `agentforge-navigation` and bidirectional sync
- **LLM & Tooling Engineer** - Responsible for AI integration across all extensions

## Role Responsibilities

Each role has specific implementation areas:

- Core Platform: VSCode fork, extension loading, message bus
- UI/Graph: Graph visualization, node types, property editors
- Agent Runtime: Sandboxed execution, memory management, state tracking
- Integration & Sync: Code-graph mapping, navigation, synchronization
- LLM & Tooling: LLM integration, agent templates, debugging tools

## Reference

The [Engineer Role Prompts](mdc:code-agent-docs/engineer-role-prompts.md) document contains detailed guidance for each role.
