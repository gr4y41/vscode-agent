# AgentForge Shadow Workspace

Description: Explanation of the shadow workspace concept for safe agent code modifications. Request when implementing features that involve agents making code changes, generating diffs, or requiring user review before applying changes.

The shadow workspace is a key concept in AgentForge, inspired by AI-CODING-PLATFORMS-shadow-workspace. It enables agents to safely experiment with code changes before presenting them to users.

## Key Concepts

- **Shadow Workspace** - An isolated copy of the real workspace where agents can safely make changes
- **Diff Generation** - Creating diffs between original and modified files
- **Change Review** - Presenting changes to users for acceptance, rejection, or modification
- **Change Application** - Applying approved changes back to the real workspace

## Usage Pattern

```typescript
// Creating and using a shadow workspace
async function agentModifyCode(fileUri) {
  // Create shadow workspace
  const shadowWorkspace = await shadowWorkspaceManager.create();

  // Copy file to shadow workspace
  const shadowFileUri = await shadowWorkspace.copyFile(fileUri);

  // Let agent modify the code in shadow workspace
  await agentRuntime.runCodeImprovement(shadowFileUri);

  // Generate diff between original and modified
  const diff = await shadowWorkspace.generateDiff(fileUri, shadowFileUri);

  // Show diff to user for review
  const userDecision = await showDiffForReview(diff);

  if (userDecision === 'accept') {
    // Apply changes to actual workspace
    await shadowWorkspace.applyChanges(fileUri);
  }

  // Clean up
  await shadowWorkspace.dispose();
}
```
