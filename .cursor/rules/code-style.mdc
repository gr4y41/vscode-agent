# AgentForge Code Style Guidelines

Description: Code style standards for the AgentForge project. Request when writing new code, refactoring existing code, or reviewing code to ensure it follows project conventions for TypeScript, component structure, and testing.

All AgentForge code should follow consistent style guidelines to ensure maintainability and readability.

## TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Follow VSCode code style (2-space indentation, semicolons)
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases
- Avoid `any` types except where absolutely necessary
- Use async/await for asynchronous code
- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments for public APIs

## Component Structure

- Follow component-based architecture for UI elements
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Create reusable components where possible

## Observability

- Implement logging for all critical operations
- Add performance tracking for expensive operations
- Include error handling with proper context
- Use consistent error types and message formats

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all non-trivial functionality
- Create integration tests for cross-extension operations
- Add visual regression tests for UI components
- Test edge cases and error conditions
