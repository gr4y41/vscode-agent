# AgentForge Agent Development

Description: Guidelines for creating, testing, and debugging AI agents within AgentForge. Request when developing agent components, implementing agent runtime behavior, or creating debugging tools for agent inspection.

AgentForge is designed to simplify the process of creating, testing, and debugging AI agents. This document provides guidance for agent development within the platform.

## Agent Components

- **Agent Nodes** - Core building blocks representing individual agents
- **Memory Nodes** - Storage for agent state and knowledge
- **Workflow Nodes** - Define sequence and flow of agent interactions
- **Action Nodes** - Represent capabilities and tools available to agents

## Agent Runtime Model

The agent runtime follows a sandboxed execution model:

- Agents run in isolated environments for security
- Resource limits prevent runaway processes
- Standard I/O channels enable controlled communication
- Memory is persisted and can be inspected/modified

## Agent Debugging

AgentForge provides rich debugging tools:

- Step-by-step execution of agent processes
- Memory state inspection and modification
- Time-travel debugging with state snapshots
- Visualization of agent reasoning and decision-making
- LLM prompt and response inspection

## Agent Templates

Use the template system for quick agent creation:

- Basic agent templates for common use cases
- Customizable templates with property editors
- Import/export functionality for sharing templates
- Template library for community contributions
